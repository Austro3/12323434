The background of the impending conflict began as early as 2013, when anti-Russian protests began throughout the country, the consequence of which in early 2014 was the proclamation of the DPR and LPR, which turned into a full-fledged war in eastern Ukraine. Active hostilities continued until 2015, although local skirmishes between the troops took place until 2022. On the one side of the conflict is Russia, which wants to get an industrially developed and densely populated Donbass, as well as protect the Russians living in the Republics. On the other side of the conflict is Ukraine, which wants to restore control over the rebellious lands. What will the coming year bring us?"

In response to this, we can hold negotiations and try to come to an agreement, although, in case of their failure, escalation cannot be avoided.

Historically, Europe has always taken up arms against us, declaring its exclusivity, as it was in the days of Napoleon and Hitler, the same thing is happening now.\n Now that the true nature of the West has become clear to us, we have no choice but to continue to pull our armed forces to the Ukrainian border.

Of course, not all the points of Putin's "Ultimatum" were fulfilled, but the basis for future full-fledged negotiations was laid. \n However, you should not lose your vigilance yet.

The Russian Federation is pulling its armed forces to the border with Ukraine, probably preparing for an invasion. Against this background, Putin demanded from us "security guarantees" for the Russian Federation, that is, a complete rejection of our military bases in Eastern Europe, as well as a ban on Georgia and Ukraine joining NATO. Of course, most of Russia's demands are unacceptable, but maybe we need to make some concessions in order to preserve peace in Europe?"

According to our data, the agents of the Russian special services sent specially warm up local more or less pro-Russian Ukrainians. Bribes, sabotage and operations under a false flag - all this is not one article of the actions of these “saboteurs”. The discontent of the population has not yet reached a critical point. But if you close your eyes to this, then not only the LDPR will soon be under Russia's control. "

Over the years, we have managed to nullify the conflict in the east of our country, establish cooperation with Western countries and even make some compromises with Putin.

ukr.18.desc: "Today, for the first time in a very long time, black smoke rose over the cities of Ukraine. It is a consequence of an unexpected and massive attack by missiles and drones, carried out on the eve of the Russian Federation. The targets were both military and civilian infrastructure, mainly allocated for electricity and heat supply - CHP plants, transformers, power lines. The public is also excited by the fact that not a single large settlement on the territory of Ukraine escaped from the attack - the city of Sumy located near the border, as well as the capital Kiev and distant Lviv were hit. The command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the population protected by it in confusion and fear - if such attacks continue and are frequent, the energy infrastructure will not have time to recover, which will lead both to the impossibility of proper nutrition of the front, and to the decline of the whole country and society as a whole, as a result of the impossibility of continuing industrial production and the collapse of the highly qualified service sector, the cessation of heating and the supply of light, and as a consequence of all this - to hunger, unemployment, large-scale pestilence and the complete collapse of the unified state administration."

In total, more than 90 corpses have been found at the moment, most of the bodies have traces of violent death. We can use what happened for an information war against Russia.

It appeared as a result of an armed uprising with the support of soldiers from Russia. In 1992, our country declared independence from Moldova, many did not think that we would be able to withstand the onslaught of Moldovan troops, but volunteers from the Russian Federation arrived in time, who established the current borders, and also helped to freeze the conflict. For 2022, our country is one of the most backward in Europe, our actions are almost completely controlled by the Russian Federation, in return they give us protection. Our independence has been recognized by countries that are also unrecognized states, namely Abkhazia, South Ossetia and the NKR. Our leader is V.N. Krasnoselsky - he graduated with honors from a military school in Kharkiv, but he did not want to take the oath to independent Ukraine, so he fled to our republic. Well, we have a lot of work to do to improve the quality of life in Pridnestrovie, and we can only hope that big brother in the person of Russia will help us."

The Supreme Council of the PMR believes that the best solution for us is not to interfere in this war, since it makes no sense for Ukraine to attack us, but our people are for the war with Ukraine together with Russia, because they see this as a chance for the PMR to finally be able to join the Russian Federation.

news.49.d: "Since the beginning of October 2021, various media outlets have reported that the Russian Federation may be preparing an invasion of the territory of Ukraine, which caused a crisis in Russian-Ukrainian relations, as well as the wariness of Western countries. As a result, this led to a series of diplomatic actions on the part of Russia and Western countries, as well as to initial negotiations, which, however, did not have any significant success. Russia was reluctant to act in the political space, and some of the demands looked like nothing more than an attempt to delay the negotiations, or disrupt them. However, unexpectedly for everyone, Vladimir Putin and Sergey Lavrov proposed to convene a summit to discuss the conflict over Ukraine, calling on Western countries to «‎ensure justice» and «‎protect peace.». In response, the United States, Great Britain and Ukraine sent a note of consent to participate in this event, although it was not without speculative statements from both sides of the conflict. Many international and national media dubbed this event as an unexpected detente and the likely end of the crisis, but analysts urge not to rush to conclusions — given Russian rhetoric, as well as the ultimatum of Western countries about some points of Russia's early claims, the summit may have absolutely unpredictable consequences, and it is too early to talk about the end of the crisis."

And the reason for this is the urgent appeal of the President of the Russian Federation on the introduction of partial mobilization. As Vladimir Putin said in his address, Ukraine has shelled the territories of the LPR, the DPR, as well as the Russian-Ukrainian border, which is why he is forced to prepare "retaliatory measures" by starting partial mobilization and putting all kinds of troops on alert. The Ministry of Defense added that only people with combat experience, volunteers and specialists who have served in military police units are subject to partial mobilization. Judging by the data published by the Government of the Russian Federation, it is planned to put under arms about 100,000 people who will carry out police and security functions."

The republic is inhabited mainly by Chechens, as well as other ethnic groups, including Russians, Georgians and Armenians.\n Ramzan Akhmatovich Kadyrov, a representative of the Kadyrov family, who have been in power in the region for more than 20 years, still remains in power in Chechnya. The irremovability of the rulers in the republic has made itself felt, all the state institutions of Chechnya are completely subordinated to Kadyrov personally, and the Kadyrov family itself has its own army of mercenaries. However, the Republic's economy is still completely dependent on the federal center, all cash flows are controlled by the Kremlin, and this whole game of Autonomy on the part of both the head of the Republic and the Russian Federation causes some concern. In addition, Chechnya has a number of problems, including corruption, human rights violations, religious and cultural discrimination.\n It is in this state of affairs that the unstable Chechen Republic approaches an equally unstable period of time. While the clouds are gathering over the CIS, Chechnya still remains a toy in the hands of the Kadyrovs and the Federal Government."

He played a big role in the victory of the federal troops in the Second Chechen War. Becoming the first head of post-war Chechnya, he did a lot to restore peace in the republic. For which he paid with his life. In 2004, Akhmat Kadyrov died as a result of a terrorist attack in Grozny. Chechen terrorists led by Shamil Basayev claimed responsibility for his murder. After the death of his father, Ramzan Kadyrov became the new president of the republic. At the same time, mass hanging of Akhmat's portraits in state and public institutions of Chechnya began, and in 2005 a monument was erected to him on the central square of Grozny.\n Now the "Cult of personality" still remains strong, Ramzan or Akhmat are often depicted on the flags of Chechnya, and the name of Kadyrov's father is worn by Chechen special forces."
