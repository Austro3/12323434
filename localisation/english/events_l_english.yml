dnr.2.t: "Death of Vladimir Zhoga"
dnr.2.desc: "It became known about the death of colonel Vladimir Artemovich Zhogi, commander of a separate intelligence battalion "Sparta". Vladimir has been with us from very beginning of our struggle for the liberation of Donbass. He managed to take part in the battles for Donetsk airport, Slavyansk, Shakhtersk and Snazhny, received many wounds, but even then he always showed himself as a real fighter, able to protect his comrades and return to the ranks again. After the start of the war with Kiev regime, Zhoga was one of the foremost fighters of our army. But the vile Nazis shot him near Volnovakha, at a time when he was evacuating civilians. The farewell to the deceased hero of Donbass is planned to be held at the Donetsk Opera and Ballet Theater. The Russian leadership also promised to reward Vladimir deservedly as a true defender of the Russian world." 
dnr.2.a: "Rest in peace"
dnr.3.t: "Girkin's Return"
dnr.3.desc: "The headquarters of the People's Militia of the DPR received a message from an individual named I.I. Girkin-Strelkov In which he requested to return to the People's Militia. Igor Ivanovich led our troops from the beginning of the fight against the Kiev neo-Nazi regime, and repeatedly proved his dedication to the idea of the liberation of Donbass in battles. But after the end of his tenure as Minister of Defence of the Donetsk People's Republic, he left the country. Although he was living in Moscow, he had repeatedly criticised the current military capabilities of the DPR and LPR, and Russia's policy towards Ukraine. Although Girkin is a veteran and a very experienced commander, he is primarily a traitor to his homeland, who has not returned to Donbass for 8 years and lives quietly in Russia. So what do we do with him?" 
dnr.3.a: "It can be very useful"
dnr.3.b: "The conversation with the traitors of the Motherland should be short"
