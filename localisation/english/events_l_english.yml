The background of the impending conflict began as early as 2013, when anti-Russian protests began throughout the country, the consequence of which in early 2014 was the proclamation of the DPR and LPR, which turned into a full-fledged war in eastern Ukraine. Active hostilities continued until 2015, although local skirmishes between the troops took place until 2022. On the one side of the conflict is Russia, which wants to get an industrially developed and densely populated Donbass, as well as protect the Russians living in the Republics. On the other side of the conflict is Ukraine, which wants to restore control over the rebellious lands. What will the coming year bring us?"

These demands were considered impossible by NATO, and then they began to support Ukraine even more. In response to this, we can hold negotiations and try to come to an agreement, although, in case of their failure, escalation cannot be avoided.

We offered the West a compromise solution that would be beneficial to both us and them, but the NATO administration and the United States did not even listen to us.\n This once again confirms the intention of the Western countries to resist our influence in the post-Soviet space, to resist the Russian-speaking population, to literally pit two fraternal peoples against each other for their own benefit. Historically, Europe has always taken up arms against us, declaring its exclusivity, as it was in the days of Napoleon and Hitler, the same thing is happening now.\n Now that the true nature of the West has become clear to us, we have no choice but to continue to pull our armed forces to the Ukrainian border.

Of course, not all the points of Putin's "Ultimatum" were fulfilled, but the basis for future full-fledged negotiations was laid. \n However, you should not lose your vigilance yet.

rus.36.t: "The tragedy in Izhevsk"
rus.36.d: "This morning there was a tragedy for the whole of Russia. A man with Nazi symbols on his clothes and two traumatic pistols converted for firing live ammunition burst into the 88 school of Izhevsk. It is reported about 19 dead (including the attacker) and 23 wounded. The shooter himself, 34-year-old Artem Kazantsev, committed suicide before the police arrived.\n Every year there are more and more similar cases, and this trend is starting to scare. Against this background, the discussion about the restriction of the sale of weapons and the introduction of additional security measures in educational institutions has begun again in society, but it usually does not go beyond these words.

As a result of the Nazi attack, buildings, warehouses with food were damaged and civilians were killed.

nato.3.t: "Negotiations with the Russian Federation"
nato.3.d: "It is obvious that the threat from the East in the face of Russia has not disappeared anywhere, and the threat of dictatorship is looming again in Eastern Europe, perhaps even more insidious than the threat of communism many years ago. The Russian Federation is pulling its armed forces to the border with Ukraine, probably preparing for an invasion. Against this background, Putin demanded from us "security guarantees" for the Russian Federation, that is, a complete rejection of our military bases in Eastern Europe, as well as a ban on Georgia and Ukraine joining NATO. Of course, most of Russia's demands are unacceptable, but maybe we need to make some concessions in order to preserve peace in Europe?"
nato.3.a: "Their demands are too unrealistic"
nato.3.b: "Let's try to agree"
