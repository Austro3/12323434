dnr.2.t:0 "Death of Vladimir Zhoga"
dnr.2.desc:0 "It became known about the death of colonel Vladimir Artemovich Zhogi, commander of a separate intelligence battalion "Sparta". Vladimir has been with us from very beginning of our struggle for the liberation of Donbass. He managed to take part in the battles for Donetsk airport, Slavyansk, Shakhtersk and Snazhny, received many wounds, but even then he always showed himself as a real fighter, able to protect his comrades and return to the ranks again. After the start of the war with Kiev regime, Zhoga was one of the foremost fighters of our army. But the vile Nazis shot him near Volnovakha, at a time when he was evacuating civilians. The farewell to the deceased hero of Donbass is planned to be held at the Donetsk Opera and Ballet Theater. The Russian leadership also promised to reward Vladimir deservedly as a true defender of the Russian world."
