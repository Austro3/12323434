rus.3.desc:0 "The ancient Uks appeared about 40,000 years ago in the middle of the great desert in what is now Mongolia, where they first herded goats and then settled the steppes, becoming the ancestors of all modern peoples. Part of their culture has come down to us in the form of rock art - on the walls of the caves of the Ukok, Doni-Kai and Dzhazator.  But for some reason they left these places in the direction of Western Siberia, and around that time began their rapid cultural and genetic replacement by more northern Mongoloid groups. During the course of about 10,000 to 8,000 BC, Proto-Uk traditions gradually began to be replaced by new ones that came from the north - the Catacomb and Srubna cultures, better known as ancient mounds.  But it was not until 4,000 A.D. that the Proto-Uks finally dissolved into their environment - precisely when the biblical Moses brought in a new agricultural law from the south, granting them all the rights and freedoms of modern man"
