rus.7.a:0 "I will surely survive..."
rus.8.t:0 "Starting situation"
rus.8.desc:0 "A Russian invasion of Ukraine is imminent. The prehistory of the impending conflict began as early as 2013, when anti-Russian protests began across the country, resulting in the proclamation of the DNR and LNR in early 2014, which escalated into a full-fledged war in eastern Ukraine. Active hostilities continued until 2015, although local skirmishes between troops continued until 2022. On one side of the conflict is Russia, which wants to acquire the industrially developed and densely populated Donbass, as well as to protect the Russians living in the republics. On the other side of the conflict is Ukraine, which wants to regain control of the recalcitrant lands. What the coming year will bring us?"
rus.8.a:0 "The year promises to be interesting"
smo.1.t:0 "NATO expansion"
smo.1.desc:0 "Ukraine's aspirations to join NATO have long since become obvious. If we allow this, NATO will receive a large border with Russia, and the independence of our allies - Luhansk and Donetsk - will inevitably be eliminated. We can say with confidence that we cannot allow the expansion of the North Atlantic Alliance on the territory of Ukraine. Now is the time to take action."
smo.1.a:0 "So what are we waiting for!"
smo.2.t:0 "Escalation"
smo.2.desc:0 "The inevitable escalation of the conflict is coming, to this day the conflict in Ukraine is a hybrid war, and in recent times there has been almost no fighting. But in mid-December, Russia put forward demands to NATO to stop supporting Ukraine and trying to include it in the alliance. These demands in NATO were considered unrealistic, and then they began to support Ukraine even more. In response to this, we can negotiate and try to reach an agreement, although, if they fail, escalation cannot be avoided. But there is another, more radical way in which we will start a full-scale war with Ukraine. So, it remains to decide what we will choose?"
smo.2.a:0 "Moment of truth"
smo.3.t:0 "Allied Resolve 2022"
smo.3.desc:0 "In December 2021, Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko decided to hold joint exercises. On January 18, 2022, at a briefing for foreign military attachés, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin said that the purpose of the exercise was to conduct an unscheduled inspection of troops and practicing various options for joint actions within the Union State. Also an important part of the exercise is to assess the capabilities of the transport infrastructure to ensure the transportation of troops during the redeployment of Russian units to the territory of Belarus. As part of the exercise, 12 Su-35, as well as Su-25CM, two divisions of S-400 air defense systems and a division of Pantsir-S surface-to-air missile systems were relocated to the territory of Belarus.. \nThe exercise will last for 10 days. Territorially, the exercise will cover almost all of Belarus, Kallinigrad, and the Black Sea. The number of troops to be involved in the exercise has not been announced. \n*** \nMeanwhile, somewhere in the Kremlin. \n- Are you sure it's worth invading after the exercises? \n— Certainly, we can't wait any longer.. \n— All right, I'll give the troops the appropriate orders... \n— Go ahead. And put me in touch with Alexander Grigorievich."

His mood was unclear. On the one hand, the exercises within the framework of the Union State were commonplace, strengthening the friendship between the peoples of Russia and Belarus and improving relations with the Russian government, which, incidentally, were not bad at all. But Lukashenko understood that something very bad was coming... \nThe switchboard rang. Quite unexpectedly, the hour was already late. \n— Yes, yes, I'm listening.. \n— Alexander Grigorievich, you have a call from the Kremlin, straight from Vladimir Putin. \n— Connect... \nA call from the Kremlin? I don't often get calls from there. \n— Vladimir Vladimirovich, good evening to you, what is the reason for calling at this late hour? \n— Good day to you too, Alexander Grigorich, I have a serious talk for you."

In the course of these exercises a lot of shells and ammunition were transferred, some equipment broke down, because there is no equipment that does not break down, and it is unlikely that there ever will be. But all this can be made up for, the shells will be produced by factories, the equipment will be repaired. The most important thing is that these exercises have strengthened the ties between our fraternal countries and peoples, increased the professionalism of the army, and prepared it for future difficulties... \nDon't you agree, it sounds like all is well and this is a happy ending? Eh, if only that were true... \nExercises are over, journalists go elsewhere in search of new news stories, troops are moved back to their barracks, leaving for their usual deployment sites. Or do they?"

Once upon a time the whole country used to come here for vacation and one of the largest enterprises of Ukraine - Azovstal - used to work here. Only memories are left from all this. \nAfter the events in Donbass in 2014, the city was temporarily occupied by DNR forces, but they were eventually dislodged and did not appear in the city until recent events. With the start of the Russo-Ukrainian war, Mariupol became a priority target for the Russian Armed Forces and DNR forces. The city is an important corridor that connects Crimea with Russia by land, and it had an important symbolic meaning as the place where Donbass separatism was stopped. \nIn a matter of days, the Russian army was able to get close to the city. The forces of the Civil Defense, police, National Guard, and AFU prevented them from entering the city, so they began methodical shelling of Mariupol. \nGradually, the forces of the city's defenders weakened. District after district was occupied by Russian Armed Forces units, fighting was literally going on for every house. Experts estimate that 90% of Mariupol's housing stock was destroyed.During the city's battles, numerous war crimes were committed - the shelling of the Mariupol maternity hospital, the city hospital and the Drama Theater. The latter episode is rightly considered one of the bloodiest in the war. According to various sources, several hundred city residents, including elderly people and children, were left under the rubble of the Drama Theater. Meanwhile, each side shifts the blame for what happened to the other. International organizations, such as the OSCE, claim that Russia is to blame, providing irrefutable evidence.. \nAfter a long period of fighting, the last defenders of Mariupol were trapped in the remnants of Azovstal. The huge basement complexes beneath the combine allowed for a long defense, but the Ukrainian soldiers suffered from a lack of supplies and inadequate medical care. \nEventually, as agreed by the parties, these men were withdrawn outside Azovstal and surrendered to the Russian army. Their fate remains to be seen. In the meantime, the city is completely under the power of Russia and the DNR administration."
