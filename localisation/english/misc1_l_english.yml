batka:0 "Batka\n§gAlexander Grigoryevich Lukashenko was born on August 30, 1954 in the village of Kopayki, Vitebsk region, Belorussian SSR (now Belarus). He grew up in a family of a collective farmer and a factory worker, received higher education at the Mogilev Pedagogical Institute named after A.A. Kuleshov and additional education at the Belarusian State Academy of Physical Culture.\nAfter graduation, Lukashenko worked as a deputy chairman of a collective farm, director of a grain processing enterprise, and first deputy chairman of the committee on physical culture and sports. In 1990, he was elected a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Belorussian SSR and became the head of the budget and tax committee.\nAlexander Lukashenko became widely known after his victory in the presidential elections in Belarus on July 10, 1994, which took place against the backdrop of a socio-economic crisis in the country. He was elected with a large margin of votes (80.3% of the votes of the electorate) and was inaugurated on July 20, 1994.\nAfter the first years of his presidency, Lukashenko began to implement his economic and political program, which included a number of authoritarian measures, such as restrictions on freedom of speech, contraction of civil liberties, and cancellation of presidential elections. At the same time, he pursued a policy of supporting the social sphere, including education and medicine.\nLukashenko won re-elections in 2001, 2006, 2010, 2015, and 2020. In 2004, a new constitutional provision was adopted, which allowed him to retain power almost indefinitely.\nDuring his rule, Lukashenko came under criticism from the international community for human rights violations, including suppression of freedom of speech, restriction of freedom of assembly, and oppression of the opposition. His rule was also criticized for the lack of free and fair elections, the use of violence and cruelty against demonstrators and political opponents.\nIn 2020, massive protests took place in Belarus after controversial presidential elections, which were deemed unreliable by many international observers and the opposition. The protests were suppressed by government forces, and many protesters were arrested or subjected to violence by law enforcement agencies.\nIn response to international condemnation and sanctions imposed on Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko's government turned to Russia for support, concluding a number of agreements on mutual support and protection. This caused the concern of many Western countries and increased tensions in the region.\nAs of this writing (22.02.23), Alexander Lukashenko remains in office as President of Belarus and continues to pursue policies aimed at maintaining his power and supporting the country's economic interests. He remains the target of international criticism for his authoritarian policies and human rights violations, and Belarus remains subject to political and economic sanctions from Western countries.§!"

humorist_president:0 "Comedian-President\n§gVolodymyr Zelensky is a Ukrainian politician, actor, producer, and comedian who became the President of Ukraine in May 2019. He was born on January 25, 1978, in the city of Kryvyi Rih, into a family of an engineer and an accountant. In 1997, Zelensky entered the Kyiv National University of Theatre, Film and Television named after Karpenko-Karyi, which he successfully graduated from in 2000. After his education, he began working in television and quickly became one of the most popular comedians in Ukraine. \n\nIn 2019, Zelensky ran for the presidency of Ukraine, promising to carry out reforms, fight corruption, and improve the lives of ordinary Ukrainians. His pre-election campaign was heavily focused on the internet and social media, and he was able to mobilize a youth audience with little political experience.\n\nIn the first round of elections, Zelensky received 30% of the votes, and in the second round, he won with more than 73% of the votes of Ukrainians. He took office as President of Ukraine on May 20, 2019.\n\nAs president, Zelensky carried out several reforms aimed at combating corruption, improving the economy, and investing in education and healthcare. He also took steps to improve relations with Russia, including trying to negotiate a ceasefire in the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Zelensky also faced a number of problems and challenges, including difficulties in implementing his reforms, the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, and criticism from the opposition and some Ukrainian politicians.\n\nAs of the time of writing this text (February 22, 2023), Volodymyr Zelensky remains in office as President of Ukraine and continues to carry out reforms in various areas, including the economy, education, and healthcare. He also continues to work on improving relations with Russia, conducting negotiations and seeking ways to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\nOne of Zelensky's recent achievements was the adoption of the decentralization law, which provides more powers to local authorities and improves resource management at the local level.\n\nZelensky is also actively working to attract investments to Ukraine and improve the business environment in the country in order to create new jobs and support economic growth.\n\nDespite facing criticism from the opposition and some politicians, Zelensky's popularity rating remains relatively high. Overall, his presidency can be characterized as a period of active... reforms and finding ways to improve the lives of Ukrainians.§!"

regent_of_russian_democracy:0 "Regent of Russian Democracy\n§gVladimir Vladimirovich Putin was born on October 7, 1952, in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). He graduated from the law faculty of Leningrad State University in 1975 and joined the KGB, where he worked as a spy in Germany.\nIn 1991, Putin began his political career in the St. Petersburg mayor's office, where he worked as an assistant to the mayor. In 1996, he moved to Moscow, where he became the deputy head of President Boris Yeltsin's administration.\nIn 1999, Putin was appointed Prime Minister of Russia, and after Yeltsin's resignation in December 1999, he became the acting President. In March 2000, he was elected President of the Russian Federation, and then re-elected in 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2018.\nPutin has implemented a number of reforms during his tenure, including tax reform, pension reform, and healthcare reform. He has also exerted strict control over the media and civil society in the country, which has led to criticism from the opposition and international observers.\nIn 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, which led to a sharp deterioration in relations with the West. In 2015, Russia began a military operation in Syria in support of the Bashar al-Assad government. In 2018, Russia was expelled from the G8 after the annexation of Crimea was reaffirmed.\nIn 2020, the world was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a serious impact on the global economy and caused many problems around the world, including in Russia. In 2021, Putin signed a law that allowed him to remain in the presidency until 2036.\nIn 2022, Russia deployed troops to Ukraine, leading to a new conflict between Russia and the West. Many countries have condemned Russia for its actions, including the US, EU, and NATO, and have imposed sanctions against Russia. In addition, in 2022, Putin announced the creation of a new State Council, which represents a new power structure in Russia.\nIn 2023, elections to the State Duma are planned in Russia, which could be a new challenge for Putin and his party, United Russia. In light of the worsening economic situation and growing discontent among the population, the election results could be unpredictable and have serious consequences for Putin and Russia as a whole.\nOverall, Putin's rule has had a significant impact on Russia's policy and world politics as a whole. Regardless of.of what challenges and problems Russia and Putin face in the future, they will continue to be the focus of global attention.§!"
